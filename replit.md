# Malaysian Parliament MP Dashboard

## Overview

This is a web application that provides a comprehensive dashboard for viewing Malaysian Members of Parliament (MPs) from the Dewan Rakyat. The application allows users to browse, search, and filter 222 MPs by party affiliation, state, and constituency. It features detailed MP profiles with information including party membership, constituency details, gender, titles, and roles.

The application is built as a full-stack solution with a React frontend and Express backend, designed to present government data in an accessible, professional manner following Material Design principles and Government Digital Service standards.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system

**Design System**:
- Material Design with Government Digital Service principles
- Custom theme using CSS variables for light/dark mode support
- Typography: Inter for headers/UI, system fonts for body text
- Responsive grid layouts optimized for data presentation
- Component library configured via `components.json` with "new-york" style

**Key Pages**:
- Home (`/`): Dashboard with MP grid, filters, search, and statistics
- MP Profile (`/mp/:id`): Detailed individual MP information
- Not Found (`/404`): Error handling page

**State Management Strategy**:
- Server state cached via React Query with infinite stale time
- Local UI state (filters, search) managed with React hooks
- No global state management needed for this data-display application

### Backend Architecture

**Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript (ESM modules)

**Data Layer**:
- In-memory storage implementation (`MemStorage` class) for development
- Database schema defined using Drizzle ORM
- PostgreSQL ready via Neon serverless driver

**API Design**:
- RESTful endpoints under `/api` prefix
- `GET /api/mps` - Retrieve all MPs
- `GET /api/mps/:id` - Retrieve single MP by ID
- `GET /api/stats` - Aggregate statistics (party breakdown, gender breakdown, state count)

**Development Setup**:
- Vite dev server integration in middleware mode
- HMR (Hot Module Replacement) enabled
- Custom error logging and request duration tracking

**Production Build**:
- Frontend: Vite build to `dist/public`
- Backend: esbuild bundle to `dist/index.js`
- Static file serving for production
