Disclaimer & Data Methodology

Welcome to MyParliament. This dashboard is an independent, data-driven initiative designed to provide transparency and insights into the performance of Malaysian Members of Parliament (MPs). Please read the following carefully.

1. Nature of Information

The metrics, scores, and analysis presented on this site are generated automatically based on data aggregation and algorithmic processing. They are intended for informational and educational purposes only.

This site is an analytical tool, not a definitive report card. Parliamentary performance is multi-faceted and cannot be fully captured by quantitative metrics alone.

2. Data Sources & Limitations

Primary Source: Our primary data is sourced from the official reports and Hansards of the Malaysian Parliament. While we strive for accuracy, the availability and consistency of the source data are beyond our control.

Media Sources: We supplement parliamentary data with information from publicly available news articles. The inclusion of news reports allows us to track MPs' public engagement and policy influence but may reflect media bias or coverage frequency.

Inherent Biases: All data sources contain inherent biases. Parliamentary procedures may favour certain roles (e.g., Ministers), and media coverage is not uniform. Our algorithms are designed to mitigate, but not eliminate, these biases.

3. No Warranty and Limitation of Liability

The information is provided on an "as is" basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding its completeness, accuracy, or timeliness.

MyParliament and its creators shall not be held liable for any decision, action, or inaction taken based on the information presented on this website. Users are encouraged to consult primary sources for official purposes.

4. Subjectivity of Metrics

The "performance" metrics are based on our defined methodology (e.g., participation, questions asked, media mentions). Different methodologies would yield different results. These metrics should not be interpreted as the sole measure of an MP's effectiveness, dedication, or worth.

5. Independence

This is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or funded by the Parliament of Malaysia, any political party, or government agency.

By using this site, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.
